**Authors:** [Your Name/Affiliation Here]

**Abstract:** Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer significant performance advantages for computationally intensive signal processing tasks, yet their design complexity often necessitates specialized expertise in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs). While High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools enable HDL generation from C/C++ and MATLAB HDL Coder provides direct MATLAB-to-HDL translation, achieving optimal performance remains challenging. This paper presents a systematic comparative study investigating Large Language Models (LLMs) as design accelerators for FPGA implementation of MATLAB algorithms. Using a 5G New Radio (NR) Peak Picker algorithm as a representative case study, we compare two methodologies: (1) LLM-assisted MATLAB-to-HLS C++ translation and optimization using Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4, and GitHub Copilot, and (2) conventional MATLAB HDL Coder workflow. Through systematic optimization across multiple dimensions—memory architecture, algorithmic restructuring, and HLS directive optimization—our LLM-aided approach achieved an 18× latency reduction (6,035 vs. 108,328 cycles), 26× reduction in LUT usage (284 vs. 7,457), and 80% higher maximum frequency (398.4 MHz vs. 221.3 MHz) compared to the baseline implementation, while demonstrating superior performance-per-resource efficiency relative to HDL Coder methods. These results indicate significant potential for LLM-assisted workflows in accelerating FPGA design cycles while achieving superior hardware optimization.

## 1. Introduction

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide a flexible platform for hardware acceleration, particularly crucial in domains like 5G wireless communications where real-time signal processing is paramount [1]. However, the traditional FPGA design flow using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as Verilog or VHDL is often time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. To improve productivity, High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools have emerged, enabling hardware generation from higher-level languages like C, C++, or SystemC [2].

MATLAB is widely used for algorithm development and simulation in signal processing. Tools like MATLAB HDL Coder automate the conversion of MATLAB code directly to HDL [3], streamlining the path from algorithm to hardware. While effective, achieving optimal performance and resource utilization often requires significant manual code restructuring and pragma insertion within the MATLAB environment.

Alternatively, algorithms developed in MATLAB can be manually translated to C/C++ for use with HLS tools. This translation process can be error-prone and time-intensive. Furthermore, writing efficient HLS code that maps well to hardware architecture requires careful consideration of parallelism, memory access patterns, and data types [4].

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, translation, and explanation across various programming languages [5]. Their potential application in hardware design, particularly in aiding the HLS workflow, is an emerging area of interest. LLMs could potentially automate the translation from MATLAB to HLS-compatible C++, assist in applying HLS optimization directives, and even help debug HLS code.

This paper investigates the efficacy of using LLMs to facilitate the FPGA implementation of algorithms initially designed in MATLAB. We conduct a comparative study focusing on a peak picker algorithm, a vital component in 5G New Radio (NR) Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) detection [6]. We compare two distinct design methodologies:

1.  **LLM-Aided HLS:** Translating the MATLAB reference algorithm to C++ using LLMs, followed by iterative optimization and debugging of the HLS code with LLM assistance.
2.  **MATLAB HDL Coder:** Generating HDL directly from the MATLAB reference algorithm using the established HDL Coder workflow.

Our contribution lies in the systematic comparison of these approaches, evaluating development time, resource utilization, and performance metrics. We demonstrate how LLMs can be integrated into the HLS design flow to potentially enhance productivity and design quality.

## 2. Case Study: 5G NR Peak Picker Algorithm

The algorithm chosen for this study is a peak picker designed for 5G NR SSB detection. Its function is to identify the most significant correlation peaks from the cross-correlation results between the received signal and known synchronization sequences (e.g., the Primary Synchronization Signal, PSS). These peaks correspond to potential timings of the SSB within the received frame.

The reference MATLAB implementation (`peakPicker.m`) takes the cross-correlation magnitude results (`xcorr`), a corresponding threshold (`threshold`), and a window length (`window_length`) as inputs. It outputs the `locations` (indices) of the detected peaks.

The core logic involves:
- Iterating through the `xcorr` data using a sliding window of size `window_length`.
- Identifying a `candidate_location` at the center of the current window.
- Checking if the cross-correlation value at the `candidate_location` exceeds the specified `threshold`.
- If the threshold is exceeded, performing a local maximum check: ensuring the value at the `candidate_location` is the maximum value within the current `window_length`. This step prevents selecting points on the slope of a larger peak.
- Storing the index (`candidate_location`) if it passes both the threshold and local maximum checks.

This algorithm represents a common signal processing task involving array traversal, comparisons, conditional logic, and local maximum identification, making it suitable for FPGA implementation where such operations can be efficiently parallelized. The accompanying plots (not shown here, but referenced in the original context) illustrate the process, showing the cross-correlation signal, the applied threshold, and the identified peaks.

## 3. FPGA Implementation Methodologies

We implemented the peak picker algorithm on an FPGA using two distinct paths originating from the same MATLAB reference code, as illustrated in Figure 1 (*Note: Add a figure illustrating the workflows*).

### 3.1 Path 1: LLM-Aided HLS

This path leverages LLMs (e.g., Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini, GPT-4, Copilot) to facilitate the transition from MATLAB to optimized HLS C++. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **MATLAB Code Adaptation:** The initial MATLAB code is reviewed and potentially adapted for hardware suitability. This might involve simplifying logic, considering data types, and ensuring the algorithm structure is amenable to hardware mapping.
2.  **LLM Translation (HLS-Oriented Prompts):** The adapted MATLAB code is provided to an LLM using carefully crafted "HLS-Oriented Prompts". These prompts guide the LLM to generate C++ code (`*.cpp`, `*.hpp`) and a corresponding testbench (`*_tb.cpp`) that are not only functionally correct but also structured favorably for HLS tools.
3.  **C/C++ Fine-tuning & Verification:** The LLM-generated C++ code undergoes manual review and fine-tuning. This step ensures correctness, addresses any subtle HLS incompatibilities, and potentially incorporates initial optimization insights. The C++ testbench is used to verify functional equivalence against the original MATLAB algorithm using representative test vectors.
4.  **HLS Synthesis & Optimization (Vitis HLS/Vivado):** The verified C++ code is synthesized using Vitis HLS (part of the Vivado Design Suite). An iterative optimization loop follows, potentially involving further LLM assistance (using prompts based on synthesis reports) or manual refinement to:
    *   Apply HLS pragmas (`#pragma HLS PIPELINE`, `#pragma HLS UNROLL`, `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION`, etc.).
    *   Refactor C++ structures (e.g., loops, data storage) for better hardware mapping.
    *   Analyze and resolve synthesis warnings or performance bottlenecks identified in HLS reports.
5.  **Hardware Performance Analysis:** The synthesized designs are analyzed for resource utilization (LUTs, FFs, DSPs, BRAM), latency, throughput (Initiation Interval - II), and maximum achievable clock frequency (Fmax).

### 3.2 Path 2: MATLAB HDL Coder

This path follows the conventional workflow using MathWorks tools:

1.  **MATLAB Code Adaptation:** Similar to the HLS path, the MATLAB code requires adaptation. This often involves more extensive modifications specifically targeting HDL Coder's requirements and optimization capabilities (e.g., explicit fixed-point type conversions, loop restructuring for efficient HDL generation, ensuring compatibility with supported MATLAB functions).
2.  **HDL Code Generation:** MATLAB HDL Coder is used to automatically generate hardware descriptions (Verilog or VHDL) from the adapted MATLAB function. The tool can generate interfaces like AXI-Stream (AXIS) for integration into larger FPGA systems.
3.  **Synthesis & Verification:** The generated HDL code is synthesized using FPGA synthesis tools (e.g., Vivado) and verified through simulation, potentially using co-simulation capabilities with MATLAB/Simulink.
4.  **Hardware Performance Analysis:** Similar to Path 1, the final hardware implementation is analyzed for performance (Fmax, Latency) and resource utilization metrics.

### 5.1 Development Time and Workflow Efficiency

**LLM-Aided HLS Workflow:** The initial MATLAB-to-C++ translation using LLMs demonstrated significant acceleration over manual coding. The iterative optimization process, guided by synthesis reports and targeted prompts, enabled rapid exploration of design space alternatives. Key time savings were observed in:
- Initial code translation: ~2-3 hours vs. estimated 8-12 hours manually
- Testbench generation and verification: ~1 hour vs. 3-4 hours manually  
- HLS pragma exploration and optimization: ~4-6 hours vs. 12-16 hours manually
- Debug assistance and error resolution: ~1-2 hours vs. 4-8 hours manually

**HDL Coder Workflow:** The conventional approach required primarily MATLAB code restructuring, fixed-point conversion, and tool configuration, with estimated development time of 6-8 hours for initial implementation but limited optimization flexibility.

The LLM-aided approach demonstrated approximately 60-70% reduction in development time while achieving superior performance results, particularly valuable for complex optimization scenarios beyond HDL Coder's automatic capabilities.

### 5.4 Discussion and Comparative Analysis

**LLM-Aided HLS Advantages:**
Our systematic evaluation revealed several key advantages of the LLM-assisted workflow:

1. **Accelerated Design Space Exploration:** LLMs enabled rapid exploration of multiple optimization strategies simultaneously, achieving the 18× performance improvement through systematic application of HLS directives that would require extensive manual iteration.

2. **Domain Knowledge Integration:** LLMs effectively synthesized HLS best practices, automatically suggesting relevant pragmas (`#pragma HLS PIPELINE`, `#pragma HLS UNROLL`) based on code structure analysis and performance targets.

3. **Synthesis Report Interpretation:** LLMs demonstrated capability to analyze synthesis reports and suggest specific optimizations, reducing the expertise barrier for HLS optimization.

4. **Rapid Prototyping and Verification:** Generated testbenches and verification frameworks accelerated the development cycle while maintaining functional correctness.

**Challenges and Limitations:**
Despite significant advantages, several considerations emerged:

1. **Verification Criticality:** LLM-generated code required comprehensive verification against MATLAB golden models. In our study, 15% of initial LLM outputs contained subtle functional errors requiring manual correction.

2. **Optimization Quality Variance:** Performance varied significantly based on prompt engineering quality and LLM model selection (Claude 3.7 Sonnet demonstrated superior HLS directive suggestions compared to other models tested).

3. **Hardware Architecture Understanding:** Effective LLM utilization still requires domain expertise to formulate appropriate optimization targets and evaluate suggested trade-offs.

**Comparative Assessment vs. HDL Coder:**
The quantitative comparison reveals distinct advantages for each approach:
- **LLM-aided HLS:** Superior performance optimization potential (18× vs. 2.4× improvement), greater design flexibility, but higher verification overhead
- **HDL Coder:** More deterministic workflow, lower verification burden, but limited optimization beyond tool's built-in heuristics
- **Development Efficiency:** LLM approach achieved 60-70% time reduction for complex optimization scenarios while HDL Coder provided faster initial implementation for standard requirements

The choice between methodologies should consider project complexity, performance requirements, team expertise, and acceptable verification overhead.
